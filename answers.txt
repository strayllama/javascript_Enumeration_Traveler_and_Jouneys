1/ Can an arrow function expression's this. context change?
No, an arrows function's this. context is always the when it is defined:
  "this. always refers to the context in which the function defined. Its context doesn't change."

2/ How do we know what object this. refers to in an arrow function expression body?
Arrow function retains its definition context, so will be itself


3/ Can a function expression's context change?
yes

4/ How do we know what object this refers to in a function expression body?
It can be assigned as a property to an object, so then its context becomes that object.
i.e
const aFunction = function () {}

 anObject.functionName = functionName;

this.property can be a property of Object and will be accessed by aFunction
